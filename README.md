This Project is based on the application of machine learning with python programming.
It focuses on IRIS flower classification using Machine Learning with scikit tools. 
List of Algorithm applied to train and test the model are as follows:
1. Logistic Regression
2. K nearest classifier
3. SVM
4. Naive Bayes
5. Decision Tree

We are making accuracy and prediction in Iris project through Iris Dataset.
This is easy and understable for machine learning staters( Naive ).
